# TR_Project
TR Project for hiring process

The complete project is composed of a React frontend and a NodeJS backend.

To execute them, open up two terminals:

-The first one should be opened in the frontend/atm folder. From there, run 'npm start'

-The second one should be opened in the backend folder. From there run 'node .'

The index.js in the backend is a small Express API just set in order to better model how the frontend end would work when consuming from an external source. At the beginning of the file, there's inital dummy that can be set before running the backed. Feel free to add entries in order to test the application further.
